Keep it a mystery
Keep it to yourself
I'm always watching
And I'll always help

Keep it a mystery
Keep turning it on
You're hiding something
That's keeping me warm

Daylight is coming
And shadows are gone
Keep it a mystery
'Till night's coming on

Keep it a mystery
And don't let it drift
It's like the ocean
It's nature's dark gift

A common addiction
Couldn't be like this
It's strangely compelling
And I can't resist

Daylight is coming
And shadows are gone
Keep it a mystery
'Till night's coming on

'Cause I wanna see that mystery in me
And I wanna sleep with the secrets that you keep
And I wanna wake with the magic that you make
Runnin' up and down my spine like when a fault line shakes

Keep it a mystery, a mystery for me
Keep it a mystery, a mystery for me
I wanna hide, I wanna watch
I wanna draw back the blinds and be caught

I wanna hang on every word
I wanna know that my breathing was heard

'Cause I wanna see that mystery in me
And I wanna sleep with the secrets that you keep

And I wanna wake with the magic that you make
Running up and down my spine like when a fault line shakes
Oh, I wanna see that mystery in me
And I want to sleep with the secrets that you keep

And I want to wake with the magic that you make
Running up and down my spine like when a fault line shakes
And keep it a mystery, a mystery for me
Keep it a mystery, a mystery for me

Keep it a mystery
Keep it a mystery, ooh
Keep it a mystery, ooh
Keep it a mystery
