All my life I'm waiting for you
Mystery, fate and love...
To pray for you, but you, MERAHEF...
Far away... NE'ELAM
Oh, mystery, fate and love
Mystery, fate and love...
My Lord, my Lord, give me a chance,
Give me a hand to hold on to,
Give me a chance, give me a hand
To hold on to...
Oh, mystery, fate and love.

All alone, all alone
BE'EMUNA UBIT'FILAM TEFILAH HO
But you MERAHEF, far away NE'ELAM
Oh, mystery, fate and love
Mystery, fate and love...
My Lord, my Lord, give me a chance,
Give me a hand to hold on to,
Give me a chance, give me a hand
To hold on to...
Oh, mystery, fate and love.

ASHAYAH... SHAYAH... AYAH
