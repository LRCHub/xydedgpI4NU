In order to see it
You've got to believe it
I do.
You said to try patience
I know that I'm ready
I'm waiting for you
You're with them
Can't you tell?
You're like me
I'm too late
You've got her

It's not enough. It's not enough
I'm not enough I'm not enough

In order to see it
You've got to believe it
I want this
